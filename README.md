# hello-world

I am currently on my web development journey that I started three weeks ago.
At the moment I am currently taking the Front-end web development track on Treehouse.
If by chance anyone does read this in the future feel free to contact me, I would like to meet more people in the community.
I am a father of two expecting a third here shortly :D.
